 <h2>What is ChatGPT ?</h2>
 <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create human like conversational dialogue
 <br> The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.<br/></p>
 <p>ChatGPT is a form of generative AI is a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by <i>AI</i>.</p>
 <p>ChatGPT is similar to the automated chat services found on customer service websites, as people can ask it questions or request clarification to ChatGPT's replies.
     The <B>GPT</B> stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer,"which refers to how ChatGPT processes requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained with reinforcement learning through human feedback and reward models that rank the best responses.
     This feedback helps augment ChatGPT with machine learning to improve future responses.</p>


<h2>Who created ChatGPT?</h2>

 <p><i><b>OpenAI</b></i> is an artificial intelligence research company -- created ChatGPT and launched the tool in November 2022. It was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015. <i><b>OpenAI</b></i> is backed by several investors, with Microsoft being the most notable. OpenAI also created Dall-E, an AI text-to-art generator</p>
      
<h2>How does ChatGPT work?</h2>

<p>ChatGPT works through its Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences. ChatGPT originally used the <b>GPT-3</b> large language model, a neural network machine learning model and the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The transformer pulls from a significant amount of data to formulate a response.</p>
<p>ChatGPT now uses the GPT-3.5 model that includes a fine-tuning process for its algorithm. ChatGPT Plus uses <b>GPT-4</b>, which offers a faster response time and internet plugins. <b>GPT-4</b> can also handle more complex tasks compared with previous models, such as describing photos, generating captions for images and creating more detailed responses up to 25,000 words.</p>

<h2>How are people using ChatGPT?</h2>

<p>ChatGPT is versatile and can be used for more than human conversations. People have used ChatGPT to do the following:</p>
<li>Code computer programs and check for bugs in code</li>
<li>Compose music</li>
<li>Draft emails.</li>
<li>Summarize articles, podcasts or presentations.</li>
<li>Script social media posts.</li>
<li>Create titles for articles</li>
<li>Solve math problems.</li>
<li>Discover keywords for search engine optimization</li>
<li>Create articles, blog posts and quizzes for websites</li>
<li>Reword existing content for a different medium, such as a presentation transcript for a blog post.</li>
<li>Formulate product descriptions</li>
<li>Play games</li>
<li>Assist with job searches, including writing resumes and cover letters.</li>

<h2>ChatGPT’s website now has over 10 billion all-time views.</h2>

<p>The official ChatGPT website surpassed 1 billion page visits back in February 2023</p>
<p>The highest engagement came in the month of May, when the website had 1.9 billion visits.</p>
<p>Over 88% of ChatGPT’s traffic comes from direct sources. This means people are directly typing “ChatGPT” on their search engines and entering the official website.</p>
<P>Here is a table showing ChatGPT’s website visits over time:</P>
